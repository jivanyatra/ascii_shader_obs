# ascii_shader_obs
custom settings for obs-shaderfilter's ascii.filter

I installed [obs-shaderfilter by exeldro (forked from Oncorporation](https://github.com/exeldro/obs-shaderfilter)

The `ascii.filter` isn't what I want it to be. I'm adding another character set.

To do so:
  * head to [this bitmap tool](https://thrill-project.com/archiv/coding/bitmap/)
  * draw the glyph you want by selecting in the 5x5 grid
  * copy the `int` value to the character set, use a comment to describe what it is
  * strongly suggest using a touchscreen to draw the bitmap!
